Each function provided by the `Jaxon\Response\Response` class to set the content and the layout of a webpage performs an action on a single element, identified by its `id` attribute.

The JQuery PHP API allows the developer to use the same selectors as the jQuery library, and therefore can apply a fonction simultaneously to multiple elements in a webpage, selected using various criteria.
