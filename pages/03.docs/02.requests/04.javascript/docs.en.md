Once the functions and PHP objects are exported, the last step is to generate the code to insert into HTML pages.
Jaxon provides 3 different functions to generate the code to send to the browser.

- The function `$jaxon->getCss()` returns the CSS code to insert into the page. This will often be instructions to load CSS files of Jaxon plugins.
- The function `$jaxon->getJs()` returns the code to load external javascript files.
- The function `$jaxon->getScript()` returns the javascript code corresponding to exported functions and classes, and the configuration of the library.

The separation into three distinct functions makes it possible to insert the codes generated by the Jaxon library in different parts of the HTML page.  
The call to `$jaxon->getScript(true, true)` returns the cumulative output of the 3 previous calls.
