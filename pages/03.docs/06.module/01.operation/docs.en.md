The module brings to the Jaxon library an ease of use and features inspired by PHP frameworks.

When using the Module, the Jaxon application bootstraps from a single configuration file, and its classes inherit automatically from a rich set of functionalities.  

The Module also provides a shared API across all the frameworks integration packages, allowing full-featured and cross-framework PHP packages to be built atop.
