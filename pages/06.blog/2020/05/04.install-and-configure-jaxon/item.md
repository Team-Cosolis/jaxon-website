Since its very first releases, Jaxon has made the choice to be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
However, there have been a lot of changes on its configuration options, which today are very different from those of the [Xajax library](http://www.xajax-project.org), from which it was originally forked.

This article provides an overview of the Jaxon library configuration, starting from version `3.2.0`.
